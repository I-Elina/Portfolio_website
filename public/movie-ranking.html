<h1>The Best Movies According to Shree</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Chennai Express</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of SRK and Deepika Padukone.
    The scenes are soothing relaxing and at the same time have a bit of thriller in it.

<h3>Robot</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. It shows us robots if malfunctioned can be the biggest danger of mankind.</p>
<h3>Laathi</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic. Really focused on delivering essential values of life.</p>
